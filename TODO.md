# TODO

* Finish PhysFS bindings
* OpenAL bindings
* Everything to do with everything that isn't SDL, really.
* Continue SDL bindings
* Possibly reorganize things so you can actually use HATE as a submodule.
* Figure out if I want to call it hate, Hate, HATE or something with an umlaut.
* Make hate/sdl2 a submodule (btw, it's based on https://github.com/torch/sdl2-ffi)
